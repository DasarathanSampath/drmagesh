It may be transmural or subendocardial. Inferior wall infarction has got some special features like the association with Right ventricular infarction and Brady arrhythmias especially sinus bradycardia and heart blocks [1]. Right, Ventricular Myocardial Infarction is different from that of the left ventricle in the acute presentation, therapy, and long term prognosis [2]. The early recognition of Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction is important because the time of onset of its hemodynamic consequence is unpredictable and these may be prevented by the administration of intravenous fluid load.Isolated Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction is very rare. It is usually associated with Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction. It is less commonly associated with Anteroseptal Myocardial Infarction [3]. The incidence of Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction in Inferior wall infarction varies from 25-52% in various studies [4]. Involvement of right ventricle is related to severe atherosclerotic occlusion of the right coronary artery and is associated with involvement of posteroinferior wall and posterior portion of the septum. Clinically Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction can be suspected when a patient with Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction presents with elevated JVP, positive Kussmaul's sign, hypotension, right-sided third or fourth heart sounds, tender hepatomegaly, oliguria rarely TR and clear chest. Introduction to hemodynamic studies, radionuclide ventriculography, pyrophosphate scintigraphy, phonocardiography and 2D echocardiography have made the diagnosis of subclinical cases easier and earlier [5].

In recent decades, thrombolytic therapy has dramatically reduced the mortality from acute myocardial infarction [7]. Right ventricular myocardial infarction, usually associated with inferior wall myocardial infarction, with the occurrence of complications similar to that in patients with anterior wall myocardial infarction.So, during the early period of right ventricular myocardial infarction, we have to carefully watch for the early complications. The value of conventional ECG as a simple noninvasive bedside method for diagnosing right ventricular myocardial infarction has increased recently.[8]. Many cases of right ventricular myocardial infarction which were missed during bedside clinical examination were identified by electrocardiography.In this study, males were affected more than females. This observation usually correlates well with many studies regarding acute right ventricular myocardial infarction [9]. This may be due to the risk factors like hypertension, smoking, alcoholism and type A personality which were common in males than females. In right ventricular myocardial infarction nausea, with or without vomiting was the presenting symptom irrespective of angina. Angina equivalents were more in females [10]. It was around 40%. According to Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, a minimum 15-20% of Myocardial Infarction are painless. The silent infarcts are greater in patients with diabetes. Presenting symptoms observed did not vary from various other published studies [11]. As with previous studies prevalence of angina equivalents was 23% and a higher proportion has been reported in patients with diabetes. Similar observation were made in other studies [12]. Nausea and vomiting were found to be a common association as given in published observations.40 % of patients admitted with inferior wall and right ventricular myocardial infarction were found to be hypertensive, equal incidence in males and females. Smoking was exclusively prevalent among males with a frequency of 50% [13]. Central abdominal obesity, a particular risk factor in India, was found in 36 % of patients with myocardial infarction, more often with females than males in whom it was 60%. Systemic venous congestion and raised jugular venous pressure were present in 50% of the patients. And also a significant number of patients had Kussmaul’s sign, oliguria and right ventricular S3[14]. The features of right ventricular failure noted in right ventricular myocardial infarction patients in this study are marginally lower So the clinical features of right ventricular failure need not be present in all cases and are present only in cases with severe right ventricular involvement. Though hypotension with clear lung fields suggestive of right ventricular myocardial infarction, a significant number of patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction had basal rales [15]. This probably was due to the coexistent left ventricular inferior wall myocardial infarction in all these patients. ST elevation in right precordial leads indicates right ventricular myocardial damage exceeding 25 % or damage reaching the lateral margins of the right ventricle. So, ST elevation in V4R also indicates extent of the right ventricular damage.In this study, the lesser the magnitude of ST elevation, lesser the complication was noted [16]. Death rate was observed in patients who had ST elevation more than 1 mm. This shows that the severity of the infarction can be assessed by the amount of ST elevation. The serious complications like cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias were observed in patients with ST-elevation more than 1 mm in this study. In this study also a statistically significant higher incidence of bradycardia was observed. Most of the patients improved with thrombolytic therapy. In this study the incidence of atrioventricular conduction disturbances was 78.3 %. Looking into specific conduction disturbances a lower incidence of complete atrioventricular block was observed in this study [17]. Of the 14 cases with complete heart block, 5 patients expired during a hospital stay.Atrial Fibrillation which was transient was noticed in 4 patients (3.7 %). This might be due to left ventricular dysfunction or atrial ischemia. The reported incidence of atrial fibrillation in AMI is 10-15 %, but it is only one third of those with IWMI, as compared to anterior wall MI [18]. The incidence of intraventricular conduction defects in this study was 5.6%, i.e., 3 cases had complete RBBB and another 3 cases had left anterior hemiblock. The reported incidence of RBBB in AMI is 2-4 % with pure IWMI and 7-10% with RV extension and that of LAHB is 3.5% in various studies [19, 20].")]),t._v(" "),a("h1",{attrs:{id:"conclusion"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#conclusion"}},[t._v("#")]),t._v(" Conclusion")]),t._v(" "),a("p",[t._v("The incidence of Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction is fairly common (38%) and its more common in males than females and the difference being less as the age advances.

All cases of Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction should have Right sided chest leads recorded during ECG examination as more the ST elevation more the severity of Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction and its complications and mortality rate. If the diagnosis of Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction is correctly made earlier and thrombolysed the prognosis is usually good even in patients with complications.
